## Overview

## Preliminaries

* You'll be making some improvements on your HW2 code this week.  Copy

the copied files and then commit to your local repository

## Part I

Re-evaluate your test cases for lastZero and answer the following questions

1) Are the test cases in your original submission *disjoint*? That is,
if we consider t

If you were able to find an issue like the one described above, answer the following in `submissions/hw2/P2.txt`

## Part II

## What to submit

Did you `git add`

* All of the files you copied from `submissions/hw2` to submissions/hw3`
* Written answers from part 1) in `submissions/hw3/P1.txt`
* Written answers from part 2) in `submissions/hw3/P2.txt`


## How to submit

Create a new branch of your repository called `hw3` containing your
final submission.  This branch must be created before the due date to
